## Overview

Setting up the github repository for the project, I headed up to create the mobile version of the page first. Once I completed the mobile version, I started teh desktop version, but was confused regarding adding a different image using media-query. After some googling I figured a way out.

## My process

I started with mobile-first approach. Initially I setup the things needed for the page, like fonts and attaching the stylesheet. Once that is done, I structured the page using HTML. It is not written in a semantic format though. Then proceeded to add styles to the page in css for the mobile view. When I started to build the desktop view, the problem of changing the images according to the device's width came up. When I read some answers on stackoverflow, I found that it can be achieved by adding both the images to HTMl and then adjusting the image's display using media query.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Js

### What I learned

Using media query to toggle between the images according to the device's width is new to me. Through this challenge I got a good grasp of that concept.

### Continued development

The more I develope pages and see others talking about them, I get to understand the importance of semantic HTML more. Need to learn it and understand it better.
